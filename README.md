### Edge Detect Neon Glow Gimp Plugin

Edge Detect Neon Glow Gimp plugin inspired by a Glow filter I saw in Adobe Photoshop CS5. It has an edge detect mode and a glow with original color mode.
From a technical perspective this is the default edge detect filter heavily modified with many GEGL nodes after it or it (the edge detect) inside a GEGL composer to do
this amazing stuff.

## Location to put binaries

## Windows
 C:\Users\(USERNAME)\AppData\Local\gegl-0.4\plug-ins
 
## Linux 
 /home/(USERNAME)/.local/share/gegl-0.4/plug-ins
 
## Linux (Flatpak includes Chromebook)
 /home/(USERNAME)/.var/app/org.gimp.GIMP/data/gegl-0.4/plug-ins

then restart Gimp and go to GEGL Operation and look for "Neon Edge Detect" in the drop down list. If you use Gimp 2.99.16+ you will see this filter in Filters>Edge-Detect


## Compiling and Installing

### Linux

To compile and install you will need the GEGL header files (`libgegl-dev` on
Debian based distributions or `gegl` on Arch Linux) and meson (`meson` on
most distributions).

```bash
meson setup --buildtype=release build
ninja -C build

```
 

### Windows

The easiest way to compile this project on Windows is by using msys2.  Download
and install it from here: https://www.msys2.org/

Open a msys2 terminal with `C:\msys64\mingw64.exe`.  Run the following to
install required build dependencies:

```bash
pacman --noconfirm -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-meson mingw-w64-x86_64-gegl
```

Then build the same way you would on Linux:

```bash
meson setup --buildtype=release build
ninja -C build
```

### for technical Gimp users reading this.
 
PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING A GEGL FILTER AND KNOW THE META

I have been writing GEGL syntax in Gimp for almost two and a half years and making GEGL plugins for  Gimp for almost one and a half years. No one else on planet Earth is doing this stuff. As I lose interest in Libregraphics I'd appreciate if others made GEGL plugins via arranging GEGL nodes like I do. I am personally upset that some users on Gimp Chat are more interested in scripting GEGL with python then using GEGL directly (like I do). They won't be able to take advantage of GEGL composers, and that is a huge deal breaker - as that is what makes GEGL far more powerful then traditional alpha to logo and script fu stuff. There is also a current issue python to GEGL tech is having where python calling GEGL can only use (gegl:) name space operations and not (svg: gimp: or lb:) name space ones. lb: is my name space btw.  and without gimp: name spaces GEGL cannot use Gimp only blend modes. So please be informed about python to GEGL tech and consider making GEGL plugins my way until python gets better. My way of making GEGL plugins will be non-destructive in Gimp 3.2.
